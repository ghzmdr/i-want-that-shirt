=================

Just for leeching a shirt

Yes, we started doing this just for this awesome shirt
http://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/


The program is really trivial:

+ writes a number in a file, 
+ commits changes,
+ repeats __n__ times, 
____
  
+ pushes __n__ commits to github,
+ and all over again!

We don't mean to harm no one and are pushing just a few bytes per loop.
Actually: __n__ * (number of digits of the commit * 4) + extra git-related data


We try to keep the program low impact by updating the script if we come up with some ideas.

Just relax and have a laugh at/with us ;)
